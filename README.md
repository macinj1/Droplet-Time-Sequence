# Droplet-Time-Sequence

This code analyses videos and mark when droplets pass over a specific location. It provides a sequence of times, and the location. Next, using the time sequence, you can create a histogram and compute the power law. 
 
The output variables shown in the Workspace are: 
  - setting: include all the parameters used, like initial frame and
 cropped areas;
  - vi: video used in the analysis; 
  - Droplet_sequence: time, x coordinate and y coordinate
  - power_law = probability plot
